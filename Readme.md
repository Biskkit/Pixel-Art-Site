# Pixel Art Site
A simple site I'm working on which will allow one to make simple 16x16 pixel art online and download it

Current features:
* 16x16 canvas support
* Clear button
* Ability to download as PNG
* Ability paint & erase pixels on canvas
* Ability to choose color (Best supported on Chromium browsers, browsers like Firefox have janky implementation of the "color" HTML input element)

List of future updates:
* Custom RGB wheel which can be browser-agnostic unlike the HTML color input element
