# Pixel Art Site
A simple site I'm working on which will allow one to make simple 16x16 pixel art online and download it

Current features:
* 16x16 canvas support
* Clear button
* Ability to download as PNG
* Ability to paint red pixels on canvas

List of future updates:
* Add multi-color support through something like a RGB wheel
* Add eraser tool to delete individual pixels
